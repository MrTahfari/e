  These are the Dixord docs. We suggest starting from [Dixord Introduction](https://dixord.herokuapp.com/docs/Dixord.html).

  Dixord is an open source discord clone built in Elixir.
  Is great if you want to learn how to build a chat app in Elixir.

  This docs are generated through `ex_doc` and served statically at `priv/static`

  official documentation.
